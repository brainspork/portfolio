    "info": "A random character generator for Dungeons and Dragons. This web app gives the user three choices for character creation. We made a “Returning Players” option for experienced players who just want a blank character sheet, a “New Players” option for users who are just starting out, and a “Random” option for new and experienced players looking for a completely random experience. We populate a custom made, printable form with data generated from several simulated dice rolls and gives a visual representation of your stats using a chart.js radiograph."

The users choices and current number of products chosen are saved in localstorage so that the user can leave the page and return to the the same spot in the survey."
